Description: Data package for the 2018 Nature Communications paper sharing its 
    title (doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06318-7). Please cite this paper when using the data. 
    The data consists of processed files ready for visualization 
    in scClustViz (https://baderlab.github.io/scClustViz), specifically a Seurat 
    object and sCVdata object.
Abstract: The liver is the largest solid organ in the body and is critical for 
    metabolic and immune functions. Surprisingly little is known about the cells 
    that make up the human liver and its immune microenvironment. Here we report 
    a map of the cellular landscape of the human liver using single cell RNA 
    sequencing. We carefully fractionated fragile, fresh hepatic tissue from 
    human livers to obtain viable parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells. Our 
    single cell transcriptomics map reveals 20 discrete cell populations, and 
    includes a description of distinct monocyte/macrophage populations in the 
    human liver. We present a comprehensive view of the human liver at single 
    cell resolution that outlines the characteristics of resident cells in the 
    liver, and in particular provides a map of the human hepatic immune 
    microenvironment.
